### Install Instructions ###
############################

### Information ###
The Avade software is an IRC Services software specifically developed to
work with the bahamut IRCd and MariaDB/MySQL database in the background.

These installation instructions will only describe the process of installing
Avade IRC Services and not anything else. 


### Install & Update ###


1. Dependencies

CentOS:
yum install openjdk
yum install openjdk-devel
yum install ant


2. Download

Goto and download the latest release from:
https://github.com/Pintuzoft/Avade/releases


3. Install

tar -zxvf Avade-<version>.tar.gz
cd Avade-<version>
./make.sh
./make.sh install


4. Setup Database ( MariaDB / MySQL )

create database avade;
grant all privileges on avade.* to 'avade'@'localhost' identified by 'avade123';


5. Services Configuration

Under "~/avade/" you will find, if installed correctly. the template.conf file.
Use the template.conf file and create from it the file services.conf. Add the
proper database login information into the services.conf file 

Dont forget to set network name and change the salt to something completely 
random. After setting the salt value please save it in a secure place perhaps in
keepass or similar software. Avade uses the salt to encrypt and decrypt password
and email information stored in the database so if you loose the salt value you 
will loose your ability to encrypt/decrypt passwords and emails.

Set the master nick correctly. This should be the nick you are using on the
server.


6. Starting Services

The first time you start services it will look at the services configuration 
and try login to the database. Once it does this it will look at the database
and if its empty it will try create the tables it requires. If the database is
running an older version of the database services will try to update it to the
same version as itself automatically.

Once the proper version of the database is available the master nick will be
created (if not already existing) and give the nickname master access.


7. Stopping Services

Try avoid killing the process as this will potentially mean loss of data. Rather
use the /RootServ STOP command to stop services. This will set services into a
mode where it doesnt allow users to issue service commands and then try to work
off all pending database work it can find. This means any pending nick or chan
registration etc, or services logs that needs to be stored.

So in short, use RootServ STOP to stop services..


8. Updating Services

- Take a backup of the database!
- Then start the new version of Avade

Once a new release of Avade has come available you can may download it as 
described in step 2. And then install it as described in step 3. For updating
the database check step 9. Make sure the services.conf is correct by identifying 
new possible settings from template.conf and if any important new settings is 
missing you will see them in the services.log. If you cant start services and
it gives you an error regarding the configuration then consult the reference.conf
and the template.conf and add any missing settings.


9. Database Changes

There will most likely always be database changes between releases, however
unlike other IRC services softwares Avade will always try keep them up2date.
This means that every time Avade is started it checks the config and connect to
the database and it will automatically try apply any database changes it can 
find in order to keep the database correct for that version of Avade.

This way of handling the database changes is ofcourse dangerous but if you avoid
altering data in the database it should be fine. This also means that you 
essentially doesnt have to put much thought into the database during updates. 
All you need to remember is to take a backup of the database before starting
the new version of Avade IRC Services.
