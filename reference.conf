# Avade Services REFERENCE config.
#
# This file will explain what each setting is and what they should be set to. Note
# that each setting has a purpose and needs to be set to something similar to the
# default setting or they could break something.

# NAME :
#
#    Services name is what the services server will be called. This is used when
#    connecting services to a services HUB. The name should preferably be called
#    "services." + networkdomain to make it logical and to follow other servers
#    contain dots "." to make it more familiar and more easilly parsed by an IRCd
#    and its various commands.
#
name: services.avade.net

# DOMAIN :
#
#    The domain name is used at various places around services such as after user 
#    hosts have been masked.
#
domain: avade.net

# NETNAME : 
#
#    The network name is used at various places around services such as user emails
#
netname: AvadeNET

# STATS :
#
#    The setting that will be used to name the pseudo-server of stats. Stats will be
#    named from this variable when its linked to services. The stats server is where
#    services pseudo clients OperServ and RootServ is located. Preferably the stats
#    server should be called stats.netname.net
#
stats: stats.avade.net

# MASTER :
#
#    The Master nickname is the supreme overlord of services. Its the only user access
#    which is specified in the configuration file and cant be changed added or removed
#    using a command on the network. If the Master nickname is missing (i.e not regged)
#    services will automatically register it for you on startup, during this process 
#    any old Master nick will be demoted to SRA as there isnt suppose to be more than
#    a single services Master.
#
#    Please note that the Master preferably should be a user on the network that actually
#    runs and maintains the services process. The master is the only one that can 
#    maintain the SRA list.
#
master: DreamHealer

# AUTHURL :
#
#    This is a link that is included in auth mails. It should direct the root of where
#    webapi php module can be found from the perspective of the user. The user will connect
#    to the webapi when clicking the link in the mail and so its important that is setup
#    correctly.
#
authurl: http://avade.net/auth/

# LOGFILE :
#
#    The logfile is the location of where the Java logs are sent. So if theres any code
#    exceptions then thats where it will be sent.
#
logfile: services.log

# EXPIRE :
#
#    This variable is used to set for how long unfrozen, unmarked, unheld, unused nicks 
#    and chans can be stored in the database. At some point after the lastseen time 
#    surpasses the time described by this variable then the nick or chan will expire and 
#    become available to other users.
#
expire: 30d

# SECRETSALT :
#
#    In order to maintain security in the database, passwords and emails are encrypted
#    and unreadable if someone gained access to it. To make sure its safe enough please
#    change the value of the secretsalt to something difficult. Make sure you do save
#    the secretsalt at a safe location in case your services server unexpectedly blows
#    up. If you still have the services database and do a new install you need the salt
#    to have services read the passwords and emails from nicks and channels.
#
secretsalt: asdifuhq8937hgf

# FORCEMODES :
#
#    If you have a good healthy network with serious people linking servers its perhaps
#    not expected to be a problem with users accessing olines and samode/sajoin. However
#    this configuration will overlook the users who are being set with +oa modes and if
#    they are NOT on the services IRCop list they will automatically get their +o usermode
#    removed, and if they are NOT on the Services Admin (SA) list they will automatically
#    get their +a usermode removed. This ofc is a security measure which will cause your
#    staff to be required to identify to their IRCop nickname before they oper up. When
#    this configuration is set to "YES" then no unexpected users will be able to oper on
#    your network.
#
forcemodes: yes

# CONNECT :
#
#    This section is for the IRCd linkage and is required for services to connect to your
#    server. Make sure you dont compress the link or use encryption as this is not supported. 
#    Link to localhost for best security and performance.
#
# NAME : The name should be the actual services HUB name services will be connecting to. 
#
# HOST : The host should actually preferably be the IP to where services should link to. This
#        can ofcourse be a different server but its recommended to run the services on the
#        same system as the services hub for best performance and security.
#
# PORT : The port to where connection to the services hub is suppose to be. In bahamut you
#        might want to consider connecting services to its own port to apply the services
#        class in the IRCd directly on connect.
#
# PASS : The password of the connection link to the services hub.
#
connect:
  name: testnet.avade.net
  host: 10.0.1.32
  port: 7005
  pass: secret

# MySQL :
#
#    This section will contain configuration for the database link. Databases supported
#    is MySQL and MariaDB. Services were written against a MariaDB so its fully tested
#    using that database. Its however upto you which to use. MariaDB is the new database
#    born out of the MySQL open source project being purchased by Oracle. So in a sense
#    its what MySQL should have been if Oracle hadnt purchased them. Services use a mysql
#    library to connect to MariaDB / MySQL.
#
# HOST : This is the host to where services will try and connect and find the services database
#
# PORT : The port to use when connecting to the database. This is usually 3306 on MySQL / MariaDB
#
# USER : The user that services will try access through to access the database.
#
# PASS : The password services will try to access the database through
#
#   DB : The database name services will try access
#
mysql:
  host: localhost
  port: 3306
  user: aservices
  pass: aservices
  db: aservices_dev

# WHITELIST :
#
#    This section is for whitelisting special IPs such as the services ip, but can be other ips.
#    An address cannot be a range but needs to be a complete ipadress. You may add your own ip
#    here to get excempted from akills.
#
whitelist:
  - 127.0.0.1
  - localhost

# SERVICES :
#
#    This section will tell services how the services clients should look like. Keep this simple
#    and clean. These settings needs to be the same set in the bahamut IRCd to make command re-
#    directions work properly
#
# USER : This will become the user field of the services clients
#
# HOST : The host field of the services clients
#
# GCOS : The Realname / gcos field of the services clients
#
service:
  user: service
  host: avade.net
  gcos: Avade IRC Services

# SNOOP :
#
#    The snoop configurations for the different service clients. This will let services clients
#    show whats currently going on to a current staff member. Please make sure these channels
#    is not accessed by regular users for security.
#
snoop:
  rootserv: #Snoop
  operserv: #Snoop
  nickserv: #Snoop
  chanserv: #Snoop
  memoserv: #Snoop

# COMMANDS :
#
#    This section will let services know which commands can be accessed by which staff. The
#    default settings should be fine for normal day to day use, so in theory nothing under 
#    here needs to be changed. Its however open to move a command from one access group to
#    another for example if you like IRCop's to oper up with any access to logs etc you can 
#    easily just move the IRCOP commands up to SA or wherever you may see fit.
#
#    Services access groups available is:
#
#   SRA : Services Root Administrators
#  CSOP : Channel Service OPerators
#    SA : Services Admins
# IRCOP : IRC Operators
